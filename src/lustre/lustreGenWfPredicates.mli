  Generation of well-formedness predicates for recursive ADTs.

  A refinement type on a field of a recursive ADT constrains infinitely many
  values, so it cannot be expanded into a finite conjunction the way a record
  or a non-recursive ADT can. Each such type instead gets a generated
  [function rec] predicate, named by {!LustreDesugarADTs.wf_pred_name}, which
  the normalizer emits as an ordinary refinement-type constraint.

(** [gen_wf_predicates ctx adt_map decls] returns one function declaration for
    each recursive ADT in [decls] that carries a refinement type. The result is
    meant to be prepended to the node and contract declarations before
    dependency analysis, so that the generated functions are sorted and type
    checked alongside user code. *)
